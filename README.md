I'm a third-year PhD student in Aerospace Engineering at the University of Maryland being advised by [Dr. Derek Paley](https://aero.umd.edu/clark/faculty/58/Derek-A-Paley).

[I work on](https://roboscout.umd.edu/) DARPA's most recent grand challenge, the [DARPA Triage Challenge](https://triagechallenge.darpa.mil/), whose goal is to spur the technological development of robotic platforms that can be used for assessing people's injuries after mass-casualty events, like traffic accidents and building collapses.

I co-lead the development and management of an [autonomy stack](https://github.com/UMD-CDCL) built for the [Boston Dynamics Spot](https://bostondynamics.com/products/spot/) for use in the DARPA Triage Challenge.

Most of the software and hardware we develop is private, since this is a competition. But you can [contact me]() for more information!
